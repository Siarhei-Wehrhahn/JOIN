        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to the help page for <span class="blue">Join</span>, your
          guide to using our kanban project management tool. Here, we'll provide
          an overview of what <span class="blue">Join</span> is, how it can
          benefit you, and how to use it.
        </p>

        <h2>What is <span class="blue">Join</span> ?</h2>
        <p>
          
          <span class="blue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management
          tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of
          their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
          method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
          efficiency (or flow). <span class="blue">Join</span> leverages the
          principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in
          an intuitive, visual interface.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is important to note that <span class="blue">Join</span> is
          designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive

            <h4 class="h4">Exploring the Board</h4>
            <p>
              When you log in to <span class="blue">Join</span>, you'll find a
              default board. This board represents your project and contains
              four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", "Await feedback" and
              "Done".

            <h4 class="h4">Creating Contacts</h4>
            <p>
              In <span class="blue">Join</span>, you can add contacts to
              collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click
              on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once
              added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact
              with the tasks on the board.

            <h4 class="h4">Adding Cards</h4>
            <p>
              Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
              Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
              appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
              the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.

            <h4 class="h4">Moving Cards</h4>
            <p>
              As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that
              on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to
              another.

          <div>
            <h4 class="h4">Deleting Cards</h4>
            <p>
              Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
              list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from
              the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
              action is irreversible.
